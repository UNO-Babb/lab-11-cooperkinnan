Summary of Grocery Store Simulation (SimPy Lab)

In this simulation, shoppers arrived every 2 minutes, selected between 5 and 20 random items,
and completed shopping based on a shopping speed of 2 items per minute. Checkers processed
10 items per minute with a minimum checkout time of 1 minute.

Simulation Results:
- Total shoppers served: 92
- Average wait time: 2.54 minutes
- Average shopping time: 6.38 minutes
- Average items purchased: 12.76
- Maximum wait time: 3.70 minutes
- Total idle time across all checkers: 1124 minutes

Observations:
- More checkers greatly reduced wait times.
- Excess checkers led to more idle time.
- Customer arrival rates and random shopping times caused fluctuations in checkout congestion.
